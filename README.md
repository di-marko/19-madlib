# Madlibs Generator 📖✨

Welcome to the Madlibs Generator!

## How It Works 🛠️

    1. We have a story.txt file. It contains a story with some placeholders like <animal>, <name>, and so on.
    2. Run the script.
    3. It'll ask you for words to replace these placeholders.
    4. Voilà! Enjoy your customized silly story!

## Instructions 📝

    1. Make sure you have a story.txt file with your desired story. Use placeholders like <this> to mark areas you want to customize.
    2. Run the script: python story_generator.py (assuming you named it that).
    3. Follow the on-screen prompts and provide your wacky words.
    4. Laugh (or cringe) at your newly generated story!

## Example 🎭

**Original Story** (in _story.txt_):

```
Once upon a time, a young <animal> named <name> went on an adventure.
```

**Script Prompts:**

```	
Enter an animal: unicorn
Enter a name: Bob
```

**Generated Story:**

```
Once upon a time, a young unicorn named Bob went on an adventure.
```

## Disclaimer ⚠️

Stories may turn out to be 1000% sillier than expected. Reader discretion is advised. 😜
